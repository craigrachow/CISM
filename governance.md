## Part A – Enterprise Governance

### 1A1 Organizational Culture


**ISACA context:**  
Organizational culture influences how people perceive, value, and act on security and risk across the enterprise.

**Key points:**

- Governance sets the 'why' and 'what'. It ensures compliance is monitored and enforced. It gives direction and oversight. Establishes the overall security vision and risk appetite.
- Strategy defines the 'how' of desired state of security. a roadmap can lead you to the desired state. translates governance into action plans.
- Management 'executes the how' implements direction set by governance, following roadmap set by strategy. Management implements and maintains the security controls.
- Risk Management is shared understanding of the organisations risk profile to identify and mitigate risk, or keep risk within the tolerance level.  

**Memory hook:**  
> *Culture determines what people do when no one is watching.*
