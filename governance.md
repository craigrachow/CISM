## Part A – Enterprise Governance

### 1A1 Organizational Culture


**ISACA context:**  
Organizational culture influences how people perceive, value, and act on security and risk across the enterprise.

**Key points:**
- “Tone at the top” drives behaviour.
- Culture affects compliance more than controls.
- Ethical behaviour reduces insider and regulatory risk.
- Security culture supports accountability and reporting.

**Important terms and definitions:**
- Accountability is the obligation to answer for one's actions, decisions or results. it CANNOT be delegated, it rests with the person who originally assigned the task.
- Responsibility is the duty or obligation to complete a task or achieve a specific goal. Can be delegated but the delegator still remains accountable for the outcome.
- Governance sets the 'why' and 'what'. It ensures compliance is monitored and enforced. It gives direction and oversight. Establishes the overall security vision and risk appetite.
- Strategy defines the 'how' of desired state of security. a roadmap can lead you to the desired state. translates governance into action plans.
- Management 'executes the how' implements direction set by governance, following roadmap set by strategy. Management implements and maintains the security controls.
- Risk Management is shared understanding of the organisations risk profile to identify and mitigate risk, or keep risk within the tolerance level.  

**Memory hook:**  
> *Culture determines what people do when no one is watching.*

**Example:**  
Employees report phishing attempts without fear of blame, improving detection and response.  
Assurance Processes is methods and activities that confirm stakeholders security controls and policies. eg. risk assessments, security audits, vulnerability scans, compliance reviews.
