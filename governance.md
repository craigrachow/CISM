# CISM Domain 1 – Information Security Governance (26%)

This domain focuses on establishing and maintaining a governance framework that supports business objectives, manages risk appropriately, and integrates information security into enterprise governance.

## ISACA Overview – Information Security Governance

**ISACA definition (paraphrased):**
Information Security Governance ensures that information security strategies align with business objectives, risk is managed to acceptable levels, resources are used responsibly, and security performance is measured and reported to stakeholders.

Think **board-level oversight**, **executive accountability**, and **business-driven security**, not technical controls.

---

## 1A. Organisational Governance

### 1A1 Strategy, Goals, and Objectives

**ISACA context:**
Information security strategy must align with enterprise strategy and support business goals, enabling value delivery while protecting information assets.

**Key points:**

* Frameworks provide structure and best practice.
* Legal and regulatory requirements are mandatory.
* Contracts extend security obligations to third parties.
* Governance ensures compliance is monitored and enforced.

**Example:************
If the business strategy is cloud-first, the security strategy prioritises cloud governance, shared responsibility models, and data classification.

---

### 1A2 Organisational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities

**ISACA context:**
Clear accountability ensures effective governance, decision-making, and segregation of duties.

**Key points:**

* Board: oversight and risk appetite
* Executive management: accountability
* CISO: strategy and reporting
* Business owners: risk ownership
* Avoid conflicts of interest

**Example:**
The CISO defines security policy, but system owners decide whether to accept residual risk.

---

### 1A3 Organisational Culture and Ethics

**ISACA context:**
Security governance must promote ethical behaviour and a culture of risk awareness across the enterprise.

**Key points:**

* Tone at the top matters
* Culture influences compliance more than controls
* Ethics reduce insider risk

**Example:**
A strong security culture encourages staff to report phishing attempts without fear of punishment.

---

### 1A4 Policies and Standards

**ISACA context:**
Policies translate governance direction into enforceable rules; standards provide mandatory requirements.

**Key points:**

* Policies are high-level and approved by leadership
* Standards are mandatory and specific
* Procedures describe how

**Example:**
A data classification policy defines data types, while a standard mandates encryption for confidential data.

---

### 1A5 Business Processes and Resilience (DRP, BCP)

**ISACA context:**
Security governance ensures resilience through business continuity and disaster recovery aligned with business impact analysis (BIA).

**Key points:**

* Driven by business impact, not IT convenience
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
* Regular testing is critical

**Example:**
Payroll systems may require a 4-hour RTO, while internal wiki systems can tolerate days of outage.

---

### 1A6 Organisational Asset Management

**ISACA context:**
Effective governance requires identifying, classifying, and assigning ownership to information assets.

**Key points:**

* You cannot protect what you do not know
* Business owners, not IT, own information
* Asset classification drives control selection

**Example:**
Customer PII is classified as sensitive and assigned a business owner who approves access.

---

## 1B. Risk Governance

### 1B1 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

**ISACA context:**
Information security risk must be integrated into enterprise risk management rather than managed in isolation.

**Key points:**

* Aligns security risk with strategic, operational, and financial risk
* Enables consistent decision-making

**Example:**
Cyber risk appears on the enterprise risk register alongside financial and operational risks.

---

### 1B2 Lines of Defense

**ISACA context:**
The Three Lines of Defense model clarifies responsibility for risk management and assurance.

**Lines:**

1. Business operations – identify, own, and manage risk daily.
2. Risk and compliance – provide oversight, frameworks, and guidance.
3. Internal audit – independently evaluates effectiveness.

**Example:***
IT operates controls, risk management defines policy, and internal audit tests effectiveness.

---

### 1B3 Risk Profile

**ISACA context:**
A risk profile represents the organisation’s current risk exposure based on threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts.

**Key points:**

* Changes over time
* Used to prioritise resources

**Example:**
Increased ransomware attacks raise the organisation’s cyber risk profile.

---

### 1B4 Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

**ISACA context:**
Risk appetite defines how much risk the organisation is willing to accept; tolerance defines acceptable variation.

**Key points:**

* Set by the board
* Guides decision-making

**Example:**
The organisation accepts moderate operational risk but has zero tolerance for regulatory breaches.

---

### 1B5 Risk Frameworks, Legal, Regulatory, and Contractual Requirements

**ISACA context:**
Governance ensures compliance with applicable frameworks, laws, and obligations.

**Key points:**

* COBIT, ISO 27001, NIST
* Privacy laws and contracts
* Compliance supports trust

**Example:**
A cloud contract requires adherence to ISO 27001 and breach notification within 72 hours.
