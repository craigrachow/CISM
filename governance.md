# CISM Domain 1 – Information Security Governance (17%)
Information security governance is a subset of the above focused on protecting the organisations information assets. Top down activity. Ensures security program and initiatives align and support business objectives. Translates strategic objectives into actionable policies, controls and metrics. **To ensure that the information security strategy is in alignment with the strategic goals and objectives of the business.

### ISACA Domain Description (Paraphrased)
Information Security Governance ensures that security strategies align with business objectives, risk is managed appropriately, resources are used responsibly, and performance is measured and reported to stakeholders.

> **Exam mindset:** Governance is about **direction, oversight, and accountability**, not technical implementation.

---

## Part A – Enterprise Governance

### 1A1 Organizational Culture


**ISACA context:**  
Organizational culture influences how people perceive, value, and act on security and risk across the enterprise.

**Key points:**
- “Tone at the top” drives behaviour.
- Culture affects compliance more than controls.
- Ethical behaviour reduces insider and regulatory risk.
- Security culture supports accountability and reporting.

**Important terms and definitions:**
- Accountability is the obligation to answer for one's actions, decisions or results. it CANNOT be delegated, it rests with the person who originally assigned the task.
- Responsibility is the duty or obligation to complete a task or achieve a specific goal. Can be delegated but the delegator still remains accountable for the outcome.
- Governance sets the 'why' and 'what'. It ensures compliance is monitored and enforced. It gives direction and oversight. Establishes the overall security vision and risk appetite.
- Strategy defines the 'how' of desired state of security. a roadmap can lead you to the desired state. translates governance into action plans.
- Management 'executes the how' implements direction set by governance, following roadmap set by strategy. Management implements and maintains the security controls.
- Risk Management is shared understanding of the organisations risk profile to identify and mitigate risk, or keep risk within the tolerance level.  

**Memory hook:**  
> *Culture determines what people do when no one is watching.*

**Example:**  
Employees report phishing attempts without fear of blame, improving detection and response.  
Assurance Processes is methods and activities that confirm stakeholders security controls and policies. eg. risk assessments, security audits, vulnerability scans, compliance reviews.

---

### 1A2 Legal, Regulatory, and Contractual Requirements

**ISACA context:**  
Governance ensures compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations related to information security. Compliance may be legal, regulatory, or contractual. 

**Key points:**
- Laws and regulations are mandatory.
- Contracts extend security obligations to third parties.
- Requirements influence policy, controls, and reporting.
- Non-compliance creates legal and reputational risk.
- Types of compliance requirements include: Legal which is passed by government bodies. Regulatory imposed by regulatory agencies and enforced via fines. Contractual agreements between organisations.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Compliance is not optional — governance ensures it happens.*

**Example:**  
A cloud contract requires breach notification within a defined timeframe.

---

### 1A3 Organizational Structures, Roles, and Responsibilities

**ISACA context:**  
Clear roles and responsibilities ensure effective governance, decision-making, and segregation of duties.

**Key points:**
- Board sets risk appetite and oversight. Highest governing body. 
- Senior management is accountable.
- CISO advises and reports.
- Business owners own information and risk.
- Segregation of duties prevents conflicts.

**Important Terms**
- Executive management: accountability. Ensure business alignment with business goals.
- CEO: Highest ranking executive in the company. Responsibilities include major corporate decisions, managing the overall operations and resources of the company, main point of communication between the board of directors and corporate operations.
- COO: Senior executive who oversees the daily administrative and operational functions of a business. Typically reports to the CEO and is considered 2nd in command.
- CRO: Responsible for enterprise risk management. Typically focused on non-IT risks.
- CIO: Executive responsible for the management, implementation and usability of information and computer technologies.
- CISO: strategy and reporting often works under the CEO. Responsible for the C-I-A triad. Ensuring security alignment meets business goals.
- Risk owners: People formally accountable for managing risks within their sphere.
- Control owners: Those responsible for deploying and manintaining controls.
- Information Security Manager: Offers leadership in determining the methodology for the identification, evaluation and minimisation of risk to information resources including IT systems. Work closely with senior management to ensure risk is assessed regularly.
- Data Owner: Operations focused, makes decisions on how data is accessed, edited, and used. Determines classification and is accountable for risks associated with data. Functional or business unit leader that determine appropriate trade offs for security.
- Data Custodian: Responsible for day-to-day maintenance and configuration of data security controls. May be called security practitioners.
- Business owners: risk ownership
- Avoid conflicts of interest

**Memory hook:**  
> *IT manages controls, business owns risk.*

**Example:**  
A system owner decides whether to accept residual risk after mitigation.

---

## Part B – Information Security Strategy

### 1B1 Information Security Strategy Development

**ISACA context:**  
Information security strategy defines how security supports and enables business objectives.

**Key points:**
- Aligned to enterprise strategy.
- Focuses on value delivery and risk reduction.
- Long-term direction, not operational detail.
- Reviewed regularly.
- Strategy Development starts with current state assessment. Then gap analysis occurs against future state. The strategy or roadmap outlines path forward.
- Assumptions - Information assets are known. An understanding of what it means to protect. Data life cycle management process is in place. 

**Memory hook:**  
> *Strategy answers “why”, not “how”.*
>
**Six outcomes of a clear information security strategy:**  
> *Strategic Alignment - Investments align to business strategy, linking security objectives and controls to the organisations strategic plan and goals*
> *Risk Management - Keeps risk within organisations tolerance levels. Embedding robst processes to identify, assess and address threats to data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability*
> *Value Delivery - ensuring security investments optimise resources and produce measurable benefits*
> *Resources Optimisation - Resources must be used efficiently. Allocating people, budget and tools efficiently o support the security program*
> *Performance Measurement - Using KPI's,KRI's and relevant metrics to track and demonstrate the programs effectiveness*
> *Assurance Process Integration - coordinating internal/external audit and compliance activity within the security program*

**Example:**  
A digital expansion strategy drives investment in cloud security governance.

---

### 1B2 Information Governance Frameworks and Standards

**ISACA context:**  
Frameworks and standards provide structured approaches to governing information security.

**Key points:**
- COBIT, ISO 27001, NIST are commonly used.
- Support consistency and maturity.
- Enable benchmarking and assurance.
- Frameworks guide governance, not configuration.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Frameworks provide structure, not tools.*

**Example:**  
ISO 27001 defines an ISMS aligned to business objectives.

--- 

### 1B3 Strategic Planning (Budgets, Resources, Business Case)

**ISACA context:**  
Strategic planning ensures security initiatives are resourced and prioritised appropriately.

**Key points:**
- Budgets align with risk and value.
- Business cases justify investment.
- Resources must match strategy.
- Competing priorities require trade-offs.
- Employees roles and responsibilities, skills and education must be incorporated into the strategy.
- Centralised security strategy is a standardised approach accross the entire organisation. Deventralised allows for local responsiveness.
- All security programs must: Align with business goals, have senior managers support, include monitoring and reporting, maintain risk management, provide awareness training.
- Risk management plan will identify, assess, treat risk. Also define tolerace, identification methodologies and response strategies. 

**Memory hook:**  
> *Funding follows risk and business value.*

**Example:**  
A ransomware increase supports investment in backups and recovery capabilities.

## Domain 2 – Information Security Risk Management (20%)

### ISACA Domain Description (Paraphrased)
Information security risk management identifies, analyses, responds to, and monitors risks to ensure they remain within acceptable levels.

> **Exam mindset:** Risk management exists to **support business decisions**, not to eliminate all risk.

---

## Part A – Information Security Risk Assessment

**Risk Boundaries**
- Risk Appetite: Willingness to take risks
- Risk Tolerance: Acceptable variation
- Risk Capacity: Maximum barable risk

**Two Types of Risk**
- Inherent Risk - The risk in the absence of any controls. or mitigation efforts.
- Residual Risk - The level of risk remaining after controls have been applied.

**Risk Categories (types)**
- Strategic - THreats to the organisations ability to achieve strategic objective.
- Operational - Releates to day-to-day operations. Failure of internal process, people or systems.
- Reputational - Erode client and stakeholder trust. May be from data breaches or unethical behaviour.
- Compliance - Non-compliance with laws, regulations, standards. Often result in fines and penalties.

ISACA context:
Risk events are specific occurrences that could negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information assets.

**Key points:**
- A risk event is what happens, not the cause.
- Must be clearly defined and business-relevant.
- Events link threats, vulnerabilities, and impact.
- Poorly defined events lead to poor decisions.
- Example:
“Unauthorised disclosure of customer data” is a risk event, not “malware infection”.

---

### 2A1 Emerging Risk and Threat Landscape

**ISACA context:**  
Threat modeling identifies potential threat sources and methods, while the threat landscape reflects current and emerging threats. Emerging risks and threats reflect changes in technology, business, and adversary behaviour.

**Key points:**
- Identify potential threats (technical, physical, operational). Examine vulnerabilities to identify weak points that could result in risk. Recognise assets including third parties that keep the business running.
- Threat landscape evolves constantly.
- Threats can be internal, external, accidental, or intentional.
- Intelligence improves awareness.
- Emerging risks involve uncertainty.
- Early identification enables proactive action.
- Focus on realistic and relevant threats.
- Threat vector vs attack surface - threat vector is a specific way to breach. attack surface is the system itself. The strong the defences the smaller the attack surface and fewer threat vectors.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Unknown risks become known risks through monitoring.*

**Example:**  
Ransomware targeting healthcare organisations becomes a key threat due to increased frequency and impact.
AI adoption introduces new privacy and security concerns.

---

### 2A2 Vulnerability and Control Deficiency Analysis

**ISACA context:**  
Vulnerability management identifies weaknesses that could be exploited by threats.

**Key points:**
- Vulnerabilities may be technical, procedural, or human.
- Control deficiencies increase likelihood or impact.
- Prioritisation is based on business impact.
- Identification does not equal risk acceptance.
- Governance focuses on process, not tools.

**Memory hook:**  
> *A vulnerability without impact is not a priority.*

**Example:**  
Lack of multi-factor authentication is a vulnerability that increases the likelihood of credential theft.

---

### 2A3 Risk Assessment and Analysis

**ISACA context:**  
Risk assessment evaluates likelihood and impact to prioritise risk treatment. Risk assessments should follow recognised concepts and standards to ensure consistency and credibility.

**Key points:**
- Risk = likelihood × impact.
- Scenarios combine threat, vulnerability, and impact.
- Can be qualitative or quantitative.
- Must be consistent and repeatable.
- Using a standard scoring matrix allows comparison of risks across departments.
- Supports decision-making and executive-level understanding.
- Helps prioritise risk treatment. Accept, mitigate, transfer or avoid.
- Quantitative - assigns a dollar value. Objective and uses formulars.
- Qualitative - uses a scoring system. Subjective usually low medium high heat map.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Impact usually outweighs likelihood on the exam.*

**Example:**  
A low-probability outage with high financial impact is prioritised.


---

## Part B – Information Security Risk Response

### 2B1 Risk Treatment / Risk Response Options

**ISACA context:**  
Defines how an organisation addresses identified risk.

**Key points:**
- Accept – within appetite.
- Mitigate – reduce risk. apply a control to minimise. 
- Transfer – shift risk to reduct probability or magnitude. ie 3rd party or insurance. 
- Avoid – eliminate activity. 
- Must align with appetite.
- Risk acceptance SHOULD NOT exceed risk appetite and MUST NOT exceed risk capacity.
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) evaluates the potential impact of disruptions to business processes and information assets.
- Identifies critical processes. Determines RTO and RPO. Inputs into BCP and DR planning.
- Focuses on business consequences, not systems.


**Memory hook:**  
> *Avoidance removes risk; mitigation reduces it.*

**Example:**  
Insurance transfers financial impact but not operational disruption. An outage of online sales systems results in direct revenue loss and reputational damage.

---

### 2B2 Risk and Control Ownership

**ISACA context:**  
Controls can be preventive, detective, or corrective in nature. Clear ownership ensures accountability for risk decisions and control effectiveness.

**Key points:**
- Business owns risk.
- Risk owner is responsible for ensuring the risk is managed appropriatly. typically senior exec, manager or director. They make decisions about risk response, allovate resources to manage, accept residual risk it it aligns to appetite, ongoing monitoring and reporting of risk. 
- Control owners usually the same person but custodian or steward of the control ensures operation. Ensure control is designed, documented and tested.
- Ownership supports escalation.
- Responsibility can be delegated but Accountability cannot be delegated away.
- Controls must be technically effective, cost effective and suppot business objectives. 
- Control Objectives. Preventive (firewalls, training), Detective (CCTV, log monitoring), Corrective (backup/restore)
- Control Categories. Technical (whitelisting, proxy), Administrative (policies or procedures), Physical (doors, etc)
- Control effectiveness and assurance. self assess, audits, vulnerability scans.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Risk ownership sits with those who benefit from the risk.*

**Example:**  
A business unit accepts residual risk after control implementation.

---

### 2B3 Risk Monitoring and Reporting

**ISACA context:**  
Ensures risks and controls remain effective and visible over time.

**Key points:**
- Continuous or periodic monitoring.
- Metrics support insight.
- Reporting must suit the audience.
- Enables informed decisions.

**Memory hook:**  
> *What isn’t monitored can’t be governed.*

**Example:**  
KRIs alert leadership to increasing threat activity.

---


2B3 Risk Register
ISACA context:
A risk register documents identified risks, their analysis, ownership, and treatment status.

Key points:

Central source of risk information.
Assigns ownership and accountability.
Supports reporting and monitoring.
Must be kept current.
Example:
Each cyber risk includes a description, likelihood, impact, owner, and mitigation plan.

2B4 Risk Analysis Methodologies
ISACA context:
Risk analysis methodologies provide structured approaches to evaluate risk.

Key points:

Qualitative: high/medium/low.
Quantitative: financial values and probabilities.
Hybrid approaches are common.
Choose methodology appropriate to maturity.
Example:
A mature organisation uses financial loss estimates, while others use qualitative scoring.

2B5 Inherent and Residual Risk
ISACA context:
Inherent risk exists before controls; residual risk remains after controls are applied.

Key points:

Inherent risk shows raw exposure.
Residual risk determines acceptance decisions.
Residual risk must align with risk appetite.
Controls reduce likelihood, impact, or both.
Example:
Encryption reduces residual risk of data theft, but some risk still remains.

Question 4
What is the PRIMARY benefit of risk scenarios?

Answer: Improved consistency and clarity in risk evaluation.
Explanation: Scenarios help leadership understand and compare risks.

Question 5
What does residual risk represent?

Answer: Risk remaining after controls are applied.
Explanation: This risk must be accepted, mitigated further, transferred, or avoided.

Question 6
Which factor MOST influences risk prioritisation?

Answer: Business impact.
Explanation: ISACA prioritises impact over technical severity.
