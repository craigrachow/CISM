# CISM Domain 4 – Technology and Security (20%)

This domain focuses on understanding technology concepts well enough to govern, oversee, and align security with business needs — not to design or operate technical solutions.

---

## ISACA Overview – Technology and Security

**ISACA description (paraphrased):**  
Technology and security governance ensure that technology supports business objectives, risks are understood and managed, and security principles are embedded across systems, data, and processes.

> **Exam mindset:** This is the **least technical** domain. Think *oversight, alignment, and risk*, not configuration.

---

## 4A. Technology Principles

### 4A1 Technology Roadmaps and Enterprise Architecture (EA)

**ISACA context:**  
Technology roadmaps and EA provide a structured view of current and future technology capabilities aligned to business strategy.

**Key points:**
- EA ensures consistency, integration, and standardisation.
- Roadmaps show future-state direction.
- Security must be embedded early.
- Reduces complexity and risk.

**Example:**  
An EA roadmap includes security architecture for cloud migration.

---

### 4A2 Operations Management

**ISACA context:**  
Effective operations management ensures technology changes and incidents are controlled and predictable.

**Key points:**
- Change management reduces unintended impact.
- Incident and problem management support resilience.
- Asset management supports accountability.
- DevOps introduces speed and risk trade-offs.

**Example:**  
Formal change approvals prevent outages caused by unauthorised updates.

---

### 4A3 System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**ISACA context:**  
Security should be integrated throughout the system lifecycle, not added at the end.

**Key points:**
- Security by design reduces cost and risk.
- Requirements define security needs early.
- Testing validates controls before deployment.
- Applies to Agile and waterfall.

**Example:**  
Threat modeling during design reduces vulnerabilities later.

---

### 4A4 Data Lifecycle Management

**ISACA context:**  
Data must be protected throughout its entire lifecycle.

**Key points:**
- Includes creation, storage, use, sharing, archiving, and disposal.
- Classification drives protection.
- Retention requirements must be met.
- Disposal must be secure.

**Example:**  
Sensitive data is securely destroyed after retention periods expire.

---

### 4A5 Portfolio and Project Management

**ISACA context:**  
Projects and portfolios must align with strategy and risk appetite.

**Key points:**
- Governance ensures value delivery.
- Security requirements must be defined early.
- Agile requires continuous risk assessment.
- Prioritisation balances value and risk.

**Example:**  
Security stories are included in Agile sprints.

---

### 4A6 Technology Resilience and Disaster Response/Recovery

**ISACA context:**  
Resilience ensures technology can support critical business processes during disruptions.

**Key points:**
- Driven by business impact.
- Includes redundancy, backups, and recovery.
- Regular testing is essential.
- Integrates with BCP and DRP.

**Example:**  
Critical systems are replicated across regions.

---

### 4A7 Emerging Technologies

**ISACA context:**  
New technologies introduce both opportunity and risk.

**Key points:**
- Emerging tech increases uncertainty.
- Risk assessments should occur early.
- Governance ensures responsible adoption.
- Monitoring supports informed decisions.

**Example:**  
AI adoption is assessed for bias, privacy, and security risk.

---

## 4B. Information Security Principles

### 4B1 Security Concepts, Frameworks, and Standards

**ISACA context:**  
Frameworks provide structured approaches to managing security.

**Key points:**
- Frameworks align security with governance.
- Common standards include ISO 27001, NIST, COBIT.
- Concepts include CIA triad and defence-in-depth.
- Consistency improves maturity.

**Example:**  
ISO 27001 defines an ISMS, while NIST provides control detail.

---

### 4B2 Security and Risk Awareness and Training

**ISACA context:**  
People are a critical component of security.

**Key points:**
- Awareness reduces human risk.
- Training should be role-based.
- Reinforces culture and accountability.
- Supports compliance and ethics.

**Example:**  
Executives receive training on risk decision-making.

---

### 4B3 Data Privacy and Data Protection Principles

**ISACA context:**  
Privacy and data protection ensure lawful and ethical use of personal data.

**Key points:**
- Privacy focuses on individuals.
- Data protection focuses on safeguarding data.
- Includes consent, minimisation, and transparency.
- Regulatory compliance is mandatory.

**Example:**  
Only required personal data is collected and encrypted.
