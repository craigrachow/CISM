# CISM Domain 3 – Risk Response and Reporting (32%)

This domain focuses on selecting and implementing appropriate risk responses, designing and testing controls, and ensuring risk is continuously monitored and reported to support informed decision-making.

---

## ISACA Overview – Risk Response and Reporting

**ISACA description (paraphrased):**  
Risk response and reporting ensure that information security risks are treated in alignment with business objectives, monitored over time, and communicated effectively to stakeholders.

> **Exam mindset:** This domain is about **action, accountability, and visibility** — not just identifying risk, but managing and reporting it.

---

## 3A. Risk Response

### 3A1 Risk Response Options

**ISACA context:**  
Risk response defines how an organisation chooses to address identified risks.

**Key points:**
- Accept: risk is within appetite.
- Mitigate: implement controls to reduce risk.
- Transfer: shift risk via insurance or contracts.
- Avoid: stop the risky activity entirely.
- Selection must align with risk appetite and business objectives.

**Example:**  
The organisation transfers cyber risk through insurance and vendor contractual clauses.

---

### 3A2 Risk and Control Ownership

**ISACA context:**  
Clear ownership ensures accountability for managing risk and maintaining controls.

**Key points:**
- Business owners own risk, not IT.
- Control owners are responsible for effectiveness.
- Ownership supports governance and escalation.
- Accountability cannot be delegated away.

**Example:**  
A system owner is accountable for ensuring access controls are operating effectively.

### 3A3 Vendor / Supply Chain Risk Management

**ISACA context:**  
Third-party relationships introduce risk that must be managed throughout the vendor lifecycle.

**Key points:**
- Includes suppliers, partners, and service providers.
- Risk exists before onboarding and after termination.
- Contracts enforce security requirements.
- Ongoing monitoring is critical.

**Example:**  
A cloud provider must meet security standards and breach notification timelines defined in the contract.

---

### 3A4 Issues, Findings, Exceptions, and Exemptions Management

**ISACA context:**  
Governance requires formal processes to track and resolve control gaps and deviations.

**Key points:**
- Issues: identified weaknesses requiring remediation.
- Findings: results of audits or assessments.
- Exceptions/exemptions: approved deviations from policy.
- All must be documented, approved, and time-bound.

**Example:**  
A temporary exemption allows delayed MFA implementation with executive approval.

## 3B. Control Design and Implementation

### 3B1 Control Frameworks, Types, and Standards

**ISACA context:**  
Control frameworks provide structured guidance for implementing effective security controls.

**Key points:**
- Frameworks: COBIT, ISO 27001, NIST.
- Control types: preventive, detective, corrective.
- Administrative, technical, and physical controls.
- Framework alignment improves consistency.

**Example:**  
ISO 27001 provides control objectives, while NIST offers implementation detail.

---

### 3B2 Control Design, Selection, Implementation, and Analysis

**ISACA context:**  
Controls must be designed to address specific risks efficiently and effectively.

**Key points:**
- Controls should reduce likelihood, impact, or both.
- Design must align with business processes.
- Cost-benefit analysis is critical.
- Over-control introduces operational risk.

**Example:**  
Role-based access control is selected to reduce unauthorised access without impacting productivity.

---

### 3B3 Control Testing Methodologies

**ISACA context:**  
Control testing verifies whether controls are designed and operating effectively.

**Key points:**
- Design effectiveness: is the control adequate?
- Operating effectiveness: is it working as intended?
- Testing may be manual or automated.
- Results feed remediation planning.

**Example:**  
Sampling access reviews to confirm approvals are documented and current.

---

## 3C. Risk Monitoring and Reporting

### 3C1 Risk Action Plans

**ISACA context:**  
Risk action plans define how identified risks will be addressed over time.

**Key points:**
- Include actions, owners, timelines, and status.
- Used to track progress.
- Support accountability and governance.
- Must align with risk response decisions.

**Example:**  
A plan to remediate outdated systems within six months.

---

### 3C2 Data Collection, Aggregation, Analysis, and Validation

**ISACA context:**  
Effective monitoring relies on accurate and reliable data.

**Key points:**
- Data must be relevant and timely.
- Aggregation enables enterprise-level insight.
- Validation ensures data accuracy.
- Poor data undermines trust in reporting.

**Example:**  
Aggregating vulnerability scan results across business units.

---

### 3C3 Risk and Control Metrics (KRIs, KCIs, KPIs)

**ISACA context:**  
Metrics provide insight into risk exposure, control performance, and program effectiveness.

**Key points:**
- KRIs indicate increasing risk exposure.
- KCIs measure control effectiveness.
- KPIs measure performance against objectives.
- Metrics must support decision-making.

**Example:**  
An increase in phishing click rates signals rising user risk.

---

### 3C4 Risk and Control Monitoring Techniques

**ISACA context:**  
Monitoring ensures risks and controls remain effective over time.

**Key points:**
- Continuous monitoring improves responsiveness.
- Periodic reviews validate assumptions.
- Automation increases coverage and consistency.
- Monitoring supports early detection.

**Example:**  
Continuous monitoring of privileged account usage.

---

### 3C5 Risk and Control Reporting Techniques

**ISACA context:**  
Reporting communicates risk information in a clear, actionable format.

**Key points:**
- Tailor reports to audience.
- Heatmaps visualise risk levels.
- Dashboards show trends.
- Scorecards track performance.

**Example:**  
A board-level dashboard highlights top enterprise risks.

---

### 3C6 Monitoring and Reporting of Emerging Risks

**ISACA context:**  
Governance requires awareness of new and evolving risks.

**Key points:**
- Emerging risks may not yet be fully understood.
- Intelligence sources support early identification.
- Scenario analysis helps anticipate impact.
- Early reporting enables proactive action.

**Example:**  
Monitoring AI-related regulatory and security risks.
