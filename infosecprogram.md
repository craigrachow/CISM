# Information Security Program (33%)

This domain focuses on **establishing, managing, and monitoring** an information security program that supports business objectives and manages risk effectively.

An information security program translates security strategy into **operational capability**, ensuring that controls are implemented, managed, measured, and communicated to support business objectives and risk management.

> **Exam mindset:** This domain is about **running the program**, not just designing strategy or assessing risk.

# A. Information Security Program Development

## 3A1 Information Security Program Resources  
*(People, tools or processes, technologies)*

**ISACA context:**  
The information security program must be adequately resourced to achieve its objectives.

**6 Outcomes of IS Program Mgmt**  
*Strategic alignment, Risk Management, Value Delivery, Resource management, Performance Measurement, Assurance Process Integration*

**Key points:**
- Resources include people, processes, and technology.
- Skill sets must align with program needs.
- Tools should support risk and control objectives.
- Under-resourcing creates unmanaged risk.
- Information Security Manager leads the program development, implementation and ongoing management.
- Senior leadership and Board provides sponsorship, authority, resources and holds ultimate responsibility for IS (accountable).
- SDLC phases - Initiation, Development/Acquisition, Implementation, Operations and Maintenance, Disposal.


**Memory hook:**  
> *A strategy without resources is just intent.*

**Example:**  
Hiring analysts to support SOC operations rather than relying solely on tools.

## 3A2 Information Asset Identification and Classification

**ISACA context:**  
Information assets must be identified and classified to determine appropriate protection.

**Key points:**
- You cannot protect what you do not know.
- Classification drives control selection.
- Business owners assign value and criticality. But some are tangible some intangible. 
- Supports compliance and risk assessment.
- Keep practical eg public, internal, confidential, restricted.
- an Asset is anything valuable that supports business objectives. eg data, trade secrets, records, systems, personnel and intellectual property.
- Data Lifecycle - Create, Classify, Store, Use, Archive, Destroy.
- Risk assessment for business owners - risk identification, risk assessment, risk response and mitigation, risk control monitoring and reporting. 

**Memory hook:**  
> *Classification tells you how much protection is enough.*

**Example:**  
Customer PII classified as sensitive requires encryption and access controls.

---

## 3A3 Industry Standards and Frameworks for Information Security

**ISACA context:**  
Standards and frameworks provide structured guidance for building and maintaining a security program.

**Key points:**
- Common frameworks: ISO 27001, NIST, COBIT.
- Improve consistency and maturity.
- Enable benchmarking and assurance.
- Should be tailored to the organisation.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Frameworks guide the program — they don’t replace thinking.*

**Example:**  
Using ISO 27001 to structure an ISMS aligned with business risk.

## 3A4 Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines

**ISACA context:**  
Policies and supporting documents translate governance into actionable direction.

**Key points:**
- Policies express management intent. High level direction and objectives. The why
- Standards define mandatory requirements, specifications or controls. The what
- Procedures describe how tasks are performed. Step-by-step instructions. The how
- Guidelines are optional and best practice. Recommendations and provide the could.
- Must be approved, communicated, and enforced.
- Framework components - technical hardware/software, operational processes, management governance oversight, administrative policies standards, educational and awareness. 

**Memory hook:**  
> *Policy says what, procedure says how.*

**Example:**  
An access control policy supported by onboarding and offboarding procedures.

## 3A5 Information Security Program Metrics

**ISACA context:**  
Metrics measure program effectiveness and support decision-making.

**Key points:**
- Metrics must align with objectives.
- Focus on trends, not raw data.
- Should enable action or lead to a decision.
- Avoid vanity metrics.
- SMART approach. Specific clear and unambiguous. Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound.

**Memory hook:**  
> *If metrics don’t drive decisions, they’re noise.*

**Example:**  
Tracking patching timelines against defined targets.

# B. Information Security Program Management

## 3B1 Information Security Control Design and Selection

**ISACA context:**  
Controls must be designed to address identified risks efficiently.

**Key points:**
- Controls reduce likelihood, impact, or both.
- Design must align with business processes.
- Over-control increases operational risk.
- Cost-benefit analysis is essential.

**Memory hook:**  
> *The best control is effective, not perfect.*

**Example:**  
Role-based access instead of overly restrictive permissions.

---

## 3B2 Information Security Control Implementation and Integration

**ISACA context:**  
Controls must be implemented and integrated into business and IT processes.

**Key points:**
- Integration reduces manual effort.
- Poor integration weakens effectiveness.
- Automation improves consistency.
- Alignment with operations is critical.

**Memory hook:**  
> *Controls must fit how the business works.*

**Example:**  
Integrating identity management with HR systems.

---

## 3B3 Information Security Control Testing and Evaluation

**ISACA context:**  
Testing ensures controls are operating as intended.

**Key points:**
- Test both design and operating effectiveness.
- Testing may be continuous or periodic.
- Results drive remediation.
- Independent testing increases confidence.

**Memory hook:**  
> *A control not tested is an assumption.*

**Example:**  
Sampling access reviews to verify approvals.

---

## 3B4 Information Security Awareness and Training

**ISACA context:**  
Awareness and training reduce human-related security risk.

**Key points:**
- Awareness targets all staff.
- Training should be role-based.
- Reinforces culture and accountability.
- Supports compliance and ethics.

**Memory hook:**  
> *People are controls too.*

**Example:**  
Phishing simulations to improve user awareness.

## 3B5 Management of External Services  
*(Third parties, fourth parties)*

**ISACA context:**  
External services introduce additional security risk that must be managed.

**Key points:**
- Risk exists across the vendor lifecycle.
- Contracts enforce security expectations.
- Monitoring ensures ongoing compliance.
- Fourth-party risk must be considered.

**Memory hook:**  
> *You outsource services, not accountability.*
