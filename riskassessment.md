# CISM Domain 2 – Risk Assessment (22%)

This domain focuses on identifying, analysing, and prioritising information security risks in a consistent and business-aligned manner to support informed decision-making.

---

## ISACA Overview – Risk Assessment

**ISACA description (paraphrased):**  
Risk assessment identifies and evaluates information security risks to determine their potential impact on business objectives and to support risk treatment decisions.

> **Exam mindset:** Risk assessment is about **decision support**, not technical discovery. Always think business impact first.

---

## 2A. Risk Identification

### 2A1 Risk Events

**ISACA context:**  
Risk events are specific occurrences that could negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information assets.

**Key points:**
- A risk event is *what happens*, not the cause.
- Must be clearly defined and business-relevant.
- Events link threats, vulnerabilities, and impact.
- Poorly defined events lead to poor decisions.

**Example:**  
“Unauthorised disclosure of customer data” is a risk event, not “malware infection”.

---

### 2A2 Threat Modeling and Threat Landscape

**ISACA context:**  
Threat modeling identifies potential threat sources and methods, while the threat landscape reflects current and emerging threats.

**Key points:**
- Threats can be internal, external, accidental, or intentional.
- The threat landscape evolves constantly.
- Intelligence sources improve accuracy.
- Focus on realistic and relevant threats.

**Example:**  
Ransomware targeting healthcare organisations becomes a key threat due to increased frequency and impact.

---

### 2A3 Vulnerability Management

**ISACA context:**  
Vulnerability management identifies weaknesses that could be exploited by threats.

**Key points:**
- Vulnerabilities may be technical, procedural, or human.
- Identification does not equal risk acceptance.
- Prioritisation is based on business impact.
- Governance focuses on process, not tools.

**Example:**  
Lack of multi-factor authentication is a vulnerability that increases the likelihood of credential theft.

---

### 2A4 Risk Scenario Development and Evaluation

**ISACA context:**  
Risk scenarios describe how a threat exploits a vulnerability to cause business impact.

**Key points:**
- Scenarios combine threat, vulnerability, and impact.
- Improves consistency and comparability.
- Supports executive-level understanding.
- Helps prioritise risk treatment.

**Example:**  
A phishing email leads to credential compromise, resulting in unauthorised access to financial systems.

---

## 2B. Risk Analysis

### 2B1 Risk Assessment Concepts and Standards

**ISACA context:**  
Risk assessments should follow recognised concepts and standards to ensure consistency and credibility.

**Key points:**
- Risk = likelihood × impact.
- Assessments must be repeatable and defensible.
- Common standards include ISO 27005, NIST, and COBIT.
- Consistency matters more than precision.

**Example:**  
Using a standard scoring matrix allows comparison of risks across departments.

---

### 2B2 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

**ISACA context:**  
BIA evaluates the potential impact of disruptions to business processes and information assets.

**Key points:**
- Identifies critical processes.
- Determines RTO and RPO.
- Focuses on business consequences, not systems.
- Inputs into BCP and DR planning.

**Example:**  
An outage of online sales systems results in direct revenue loss and reputational damage.

---

### 2B3 Risk Register

**ISACA context:**  
A risk register documents identified risks, their analysis, ownership, and treatment status.

**Key points:**
- Central source of risk information.
- Assigns ownership and accountability.
- Supports reporting and monitoring.
- Must be kept current.

**Example:**  
Each cyber risk includes a description, likelihood, impact, owner, and mitigation plan.

---

### 2B4 Risk Analysis Methodologies

**ISACA context:**  
Risk analysis methodologies provide structured approaches to evaluate risk.

**Key points:**
- Qualitative: high/medium/low.
- Quantitative: financial values and probabilities.
- Hybrid approaches are common.
- Choose methodology appropriate to maturity.

**Example:**  
A mature organisation uses financial loss estimates, while others use qualitative scoring.

---

### 2B5 Inherent and Residual Risk

**ISACA context:**  
Inherent risk exists before controls; residual risk remains after controls are applied.

**Key points:**
- Inherent risk shows raw exposure.
- Residual risk determines acceptance decisions.
- Residual risk must align with risk appetite.
- Controls reduce likelihood, impact, or both.

**Example:**  
Encryption reduces residual risk of data theft, but some risk still remains.

## Practice Exam Questions – Domain 2

### Question 1
**What is the PRIMARY purpose of a risk assessment?**

**Answer:** To support informed business decisions.  
**Explanation:** Risk assessments exist to enable decision-making, not to catalogue threats.

---

### Question 2
**Which best describes a risk event?**

**Answer:** A potential occurrence that negatively impacts business objectives.  
**Explanation:** Risk events describe outcomes, not threats or vulnerabilities alone.

---

### Question 3
**What is the MAIN output of a business impact analysis (BIA)?**

**Answer:** Prioritised business processes and recovery requirements.  
**Explanation:** BIAs identify what matters most and how quickly it must be restored.

---

### Question 4
**What is the PRIMARY benefit of risk scenarios?**

**Answer:** Improved consistency and clarity in risk evaluation.  
**Explanation:** Scenarios help leadership understand and compare risks.

---

### Question 5
**What does residual risk represent?**

**Answer:** Risk remaining after controls are applied.  
**Explanation:** This risk must be accepted, mitigated further, transferred, or avoided.

---

### Question 6
**Which factor MOST influences risk prioritisation?**

**Answer:** Business impact.  
**Explanation:** ISACA prioritises impact over technical severity.

## Exam Tip

For Domain 2 questions, always:
- Focus on **business impact**
- Prefer **structured, repeatable processes**
- Choose answers that support **executive decision-making**
- Avoid answers that focus purely on tools or technology
