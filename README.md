# <div align="center" dir="auto">My Notes for CISM (Certified Information Security Manager) Exam</div>
The [CISM](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism) (Certified Information Security Manager) exam, offered by ISACA, validates expertise in information security governance, risk management, program development, and incident management, focusing on management over technical details.  
The exam assesses strategic application of security to business goals, with domains covering Governance, Risk Management, Program Development, and Incident Management.

It's a 150-question, 4-hour, multiple-choice test, with a passing score of 450/800, requiring 5 years of relevant experience for certification after passing.   

This repository provides notes and resources I have collated while studying for the exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material and may be more/less comprehensive based on areas of my expertise. This repository is in no way affiliated with ISACA and highly references other study resources.
