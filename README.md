# <div align="center" dir="auto">My Notes for CISM (Certified Information Security Manager) Exam</div>
The [CISM](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism) (Certified Information Security Manager) exam, offered by ISACA, validates expertise in information security governance, risk management, program development, and incident management, focusing on management over technical details.  
The exam assesses strategic application of security to business goals, with domains covering Governance, Risk Management, Program Development, and Incident Management.

It's a 150-question, 4-hour, multiple-choice test, with a passing score of 450/800, requiring 5 years of relevant experience for certification after passing.   

This repository provides notes and resources I have collated while studying for the exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material and may be more/less comprehensive based on areas of my expertise. This repository is in no way affiliated with ISACA and highly references other study resources.

## Domains and Objectives Expanded
**Engagement management (13%)**     
- Planning and scoping: defining rules of engagement, testing windows, and target selection. 
- Legal and ethical compliance: ensuring authorization letters, mandatory reporting, and adherence to regulations.  
- Collaboration and communication: aligning with stakeholders through peer reviews, escalation paths, and risk articulation.
- Penetration test reports: creating reports with executive summaries, findings, and remediation recommendations.

**Reconnaissance and enumeration (21%)** 
- Active and passive reconnaissance: gathering information using open-source intelligence (OSINT), network sniffing, and protocol scanning.
- Enumeration techniques: performing DNS enumeration, service discovery, and directory enumeration.
- Reconnaissance tools: using tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Shodan for information gathering.
- Script modification: customizing Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripts for reconnaissance and enumeration.

**Vulnerability discovery and analysis (17%)** 
- Vulnerability scans: conducting authenticated, unauthenticated, static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST).
- Result analysis: validating findings, troubleshooting configurations, and identifying false positives.
- Discovery tools: using tools like Nessus, Nikto, and OpenVAS for vulnerability discovery.

**Attacks and exploits (35%)** 
- Network attacks: performing VLAN hopping, on-path attacks, and service exploitation.
- Authentication attacks: executing brute-force attacks, pass-the-hash, and credential stuffing.
- Host-based attacks: conducting privilege escalation, process injection, and credential dumping.
- Web application attacks: performing SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal.
- Cloud-based attacks: exploiting container escapes, metadata service attacks, and identity and access management (IAM) misconfiguration.
- AI attacks: explaining prompt injection and model manipulation against artificial intelligence systems.

**Post-exploitation and lateral movement (14%)** 
- Post-exploitation activities: establishing persistence, performing lateral movement, and cleaning up artifacts.
- Documentation: creating attack narratives and providing remediation recommendations.
