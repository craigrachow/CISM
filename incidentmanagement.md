# CISM – Incident Management (30%)
## Domain: Incident Management

Incident management ensures the organization can **prepare for, respond to, recover from, and learn from information security incidents** in a way that minimizes business impact and supports organizational objectives.

---

## A. Incident Management Readiness

### 4A1 Incident Response Plan (IRP)
**ISACA view:**  
A documented, approved, and tested plan that defines **roles, responsibilities, procedures, and communication paths** for detecting, responding to, and recovering from information security incidents.

**Key context:**
- Must be **business-aligned**, not purely technical
- Defines **who does what, when, and how**
- Approved by senior management
- Integrated with BCP and DRP

**Example:**  
A ransomware IRP defines escalation to legal and executive leadership before engaging law enforcement or paying ransom.

**Exam tip:**  
Plans should be **tested and updated regularly**. An untested IRP is considered ineffective.

---

### 4A2 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
**ISACA view:**  
A process to identify and prioritize **critical business processes**, assess the **impact of disruptions**, and define **recovery requirements**.

**Key context:**
- Determines **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**
- Focuses on **business impact**, not threats
- Foundation for BCP and DRP

**Example:**  
Payroll downtime of 24 hours is acceptable; customer billing downtime of 2 hours is not.

**Exam tip:**  
BIA answers **“how bad is it?”**, not **“how likely is it?”**

---

### 4A3 Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
**ISACA view:**  
A plan to maintain or resume **critical business functions** during and after a disruption.

**Key context:**
- Business-owned, IT-supported
- Covers people, facilities, suppliers, and processes
- Based on BIA outcomes

**Example:**  
Manual order processing procedures during system outages.

**Exam tip:**  
BCP is broader than IT — it includes **people and operations**.

---

### 4A4 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
**ISACA view:**  
A plan focused on restoring **IT systems, data, and infrastructure** after a disruption.

**Key context:**
- IT-focused subset of BCP
- Includes backups, system restoration, failover
- Driven by BIA-defined RTOs/RPOs

**Example:**  
Restoring ERP systems from an offsite backup within 6 hours.

**Exam tip:**  
DRP supports BCP, not the other way around.

---

### 4A5 Incident Classification / Categorization
**ISACA view:**  
A structured method to **categorize incidents by type, severity, and impact** to ensure appropriate response and escalation.

**Key context:**
- Enables consistent handling
- Drives escalation thresholds
- Prevents under- or over-reaction

**Example:**  
- Severity 1: Data breach involving PII  
- Severity 3: Malware blocked by endpoint protection

**Exam tip:**  
Classification ensures **proportional response**.

---

### 4A6 Incident Management Training, Testing, and Evaluation
**ISACA view:**  
Ongoing activities to ensure personnel are **capable, prepared, and effective** in executing incident management responsibilities.

**Key context:**
- Tabletop exercises
- Simulations
- Lessons learned
- Role-based training

**Example:**  
Annual ransomware tabletop involving executives and legal counsel.

**Exam tip:**  
Testing validates **people and process**, not just technology.

---

## B. Incident Management Operations

### 4B1 Incident Management Tools and Techniques
**ISACA view:**  
Tools and methods used to **detect, analyze, respond to, and document incidents**.

**Key context:**
- SIEM, SOAR, ticketing systems
- Forensics tools
- Log analysis

**Example:**  
Using a SIEM to correlate alerts and trigger an automated response playbook.

**Exam tip:**  
Tools support processes — they do not replace governance.

---

### 4B2 Incident Investigation and Evaluation
**ISACA view:**  
Activities to **identify root cause, scope, and impact** of an incident.

**Key context:**
- Evidence preservation
- Chain of custody
- Legal and regulatory considerations

**Example:**  
Determining how an attacker gained initial access through a compromised VPN account.

**Exam tip:**  
Investigation must support **legal defensibility**.

---

### 4B3 Incident Containment Methods
**ISACA view:**  
Actions taken to **limit the spread and impact** of an incident.

**Key context:**
- Short-term containment (isolate systems)
- Long-term containment (temporary fixes)
- Balance speed vs business impact

**Example:**  
Disconnecting infected endpoints from the network.

**Exam tip:**  
Containment decisions consider **business impact**, not just security.

---

### 4B4 Incident Response Communications
**ISACA view:**  
Defined processes for **internal and external communication** during an incident.

**Key context:**
- Executive notifications
- Regulatory reporting
- Customer communications
- Single source of truth

**Example:**  
Legal approves breach notifications before customer communication.

**Exam tip:**  
Poor communication often causes more damage than the incident itself.

---

### 4B5 Incident Eradication and Recovery
**ISACA view:**  
Removal of incident root cause and restoration of systems to normal operations.

**Key context:**
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Remove malware
- Restore systems securely
- Validate integrity

**Example:**  
Rebuilding compromised servers rather than cleaning them.

**Exam tip:**  
Recovery includes **verification**, not just restoration.

---

### 4B6 Post-Incident Review Practices
**ISACA view:**  
Formal review to identify **lessons learned and improvement opportunities**.

**Key context:**
- Root cause analysis
- Control gaps
- Process improvements
- Metrics update

**Example:**  
Updating IRP after discovering unclear escalation paths.

**Exam tip:**  
Post-incident reviews drive **continuous improvement**.

## Example CISM Exam Questions

### Question 1
What is the PRIMARY purpose of a Business Impact Analysis (BIA)?

**Answer:**  
To identify critical business processes and determine acceptable downtime.

**Explanation:**  
BIA focuses on **impact and recovery requirements**, not threats or controls.

---

### Question 2
Who should OWN the Business Continuity Plan?

**Answer:**  
Business management.

**Explanation:**  
BCP is business-owned with IT providing support.

---

### Question 3
What is the MOST important consideration when classifying incidents?

**Answer:**  
Business impact.

---

### Question 4
What is the PRIMARY reason to conduct post-incident reviews?

**Answer:**  
To improve future incident response effectiveness.

The goal is **continuous improvement**, not blame.

---

### Question 5
Which activity should occur FIRST when responding to a confirmed incident?

**Answer:**

**Explanation:**  
Immediate containment reduces damage before full investigation.

---

### Question 6
